You can leverage https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#distributedConfiguration[Distributed Configuration] and rely on Azure Key Vault to store your Key/Value secret pairs.

To enable it, add a `src/main/resources/bootstrap.yml` configuration file to your project:

.bootstrap.yml
[source,yaml]
----
micronaut:
    application:
        name: hello-world
    config-client:
        enabled: true
azure:
  key-vault:
    vault-url: <key_vault_url>
----

vaultUrl can be obtained from the Azure portal:

IMPORTANT: Make sure you have configured the correct credentials on your project following the <<azureSdk, Setting up Azure SDK >> section.
And that the service account you designated your application has proper rights to read secrets. Follow the official link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/rbac-guide?tabs=azure-cli[Access Control] guide for Azure Key Vault if you need more information.
